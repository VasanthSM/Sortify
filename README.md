## Overview

**Sortify** is a data filtering web app designed to help users find products from a collection based on specific filters such as size, price range, and name. Whether you're browsing through a large e-commerce catalog or working with a dataset, Sortify provides an intuitive interface to narrow down the options and view only what you're interested in. The app's clean and responsive design ensures users can easily sort and filter products on both desktop and mobile devices.
